* Timewaster - a bubble popping game that I tinkered with for a while (on the train). Pop the non-red bubbles and try to get a high score! red bubbles change color after a while and can be popped, but you must keep popping bubbles to reset the timer or you will lose!
* Discord Bot - a  python discord Bot with a few features for our personal server
